# The Lovecraft Corpus

H.P. Lovecraft's works are largely out of copyright and are relatively easy to
obtain digitally. However, I was unable to come across a corpus that had every
story split out into its own file. This corpus corrects that.

This corpus is **very bare bones**. It has basically no work done on it and no
readymade resources for natural language processes. Those may come later but
for now this corpus just contains the stories.
